- 👋 Hi, I’m @elliveny
- 👀 I’m interested in developing products and solutions on AWS, especially ones which use the awesome AWS CDK
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make the best use of Github and Twitter - I've worked on plenty of code but I'm fairly new to this...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project which uses CDK to deploy complex infrastructure in a simple way
- 📫 You'll find me here, or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elliveny)
